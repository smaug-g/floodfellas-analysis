# floodfellas-analysis
Scripts for pulling data from aws and plotting/saving.

The only scripts that work are sonar/localAnalysis.py and radar/localAnalysis.py. All of our data is serialized into .pkl files in each directory. 

Use the other scripts as templates for pulling data from AWS S3. The keys in there won't work.
